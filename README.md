In this task, I needed to analyze monthly revenue and order volume.
I have taken a dataset named "Online Sales Data" from Kaggle.
I have used 2 SQL queries for this, one which gives Order_Year, Order_Month, 
Monthly_Revenue and Order_Volume for all months and another which gives the 
same but for specific time periods by specifying the date.
The Dataset, "Task-6_Queries" (.sql file), and Screenshots of the result 
tables are uploaded.
